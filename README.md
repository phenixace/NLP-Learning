# NLP-Learning
In this repository, I will read, explain and code some classical paper in this repository. I will keep update if I have time.

Sometimes, reading papers will not solve the problem we may encounter. Technical details are also important. 

# Environment
1. Python 3.8
2. Pytorch 1.9.0

# Paper List
I will start from Pre-trained models first.
